## Normal Distribution

A Normal distribution (also known as a Gaussian distribution)is a bell shaped distribution of a random variable of X. Data that are *normally* distributed appear frequently in nature and are a consequence of the Central Limit Theorem [Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) and are therefore the basis of a high proportion of statistical analyses.

An explanation of the Normal distribution and it's uses in statistical analyses can be found here [Khanacademy.org](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/modeling-distributions-of-data/more-on-normal-distributions/v/introduction-to-the-normal-distribution)
