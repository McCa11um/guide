## Eigenvalue

When used in [linear algebra (Wikipedia.org)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) an Eigenvalue (also known as a characteristic value or characteristic root) is a [scalar (Wikipedia.org)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics)) associated with a system of equations (i.e. a matrix equation). 

A good introduction to Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors can be found [here (Khanacademy.org)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/alternate-bases/eigen-everything/v/linear-algebra-introduction-to-eigenvalues-and-eigenvectors)
